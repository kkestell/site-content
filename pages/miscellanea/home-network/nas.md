# System Setup Summary

## External USB HDD
Connect an external USB HDD to the system and identify it using the `lsblk` command. After confirming the device name, create a mount point at `/mnt/external`. To ensure the drive auto-mounts at boot, retrieve the UUID of the device using `blkid`:

```bash
sudo blkid /dev/sdd1
```

Add an entry to `/etc/fstab` to automatically mount the drive on startup:

```bash
UUID=your-uuid-here /mnt/external ext4 defaults 0 2
```

Reload the system with `sudo mount -a` to mount the drive immediately.

## Western Digital NAS Drives (RAID1 Removal)
Identify two Western Digital NAS drives, originally configured in RAID1, in the system. These drives were previously used in a QNAP NAS, which typically uses a RAID configuration with LVM for disk management. Use this configuration to combine RAID for redundancy and LVM for flexible volume management.

Identify the active RAID arrays using the following command:

```bash
cat /proc/mdstat
```

To remove the RAID1 setup, stop the RAID arrays using `mdadm`:

```bash
sudo mdadm --stop /dev/md123
sudo mdadm --stop /dev/md124
sudo mdadm --stop /dev/md125
sudo mdadm --stop /dev/md126
sudo mdadm --stop /dev/md127
```

Clear the RAID superblocks from the drives:

```bash
sudo mdadm --zero-superblock /dev/sdb3
sudo mdadm --zero-superblock /dev/sdc3
```

Deactivate the logical volumes:

```bash
sudo lvchange -an vg1/lv1
sudo lvchange -an vg1/lv544
```

Remove the logical volumes and volume groups:

```bash
sudo lvremove /dev/vg1/lv1
sudo lvremove /dev/vg1/lv544
sudo vgremove vg1
```

Clear the physical volumes:

```bash
sudo pvremove /dev/sdb3
sudo pvremove /dev/sdc3
```

Delete existing partitions on `/dev/sdb` and `/dev/sdc` using `fdisk`:

```bash
sudo fdisk /dev/sdb
sudo fdisk /dev/sdc
```

Create new ext4 filesystems on both drives:

```bash
sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/sdb1
sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/sdc1
```

Create mount points at `/mnt/drive1` and `/mnt/drive2`, and mount the drives:

```bash
sudo mkdir -p /mnt/drive1
sudo mkdir -p /mnt/drive2
sudo mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt/drive1
sudo mount /dev/sdc1 /mnt/drive2
```

Retrieve the UUIDs of both drives:

```bash
sudo blkid /dev/sdb1
sudo blkid /dev/sdc1
```

Add entries to `/etc/fstab` to ensure auto-mounting:

```bash
# Western Digital 4TB #1
/dev/disk/by-uuid/5feead0e-89c5-4339-a777-fcbfa9ace876 /mnt/drive1 ext4 defaults 0 1

# Western Digital 4TB #2
/dev/disk/by-uuid/9b73c31c-e610-4f56-8e3f-7362f61904fa /mnt/drive2 ext4 defaults 0 1
```

## Seagate 14TB Drive
Unmount the Seagate 14TB drive, which was previously mounted at `/seagate`:

```bash
sudo umount /seagate
```

Retrieve the UUID of the drive:

```bash
sudo blkid /dev/sdd1
```

Add an entry to `/etc/fstab` to mount the drive at `/mnt/drive3`:

```bash
# Seagate External 14TB
/dev/disk/by-uuid/b40810fe-764a-428a-8f0c-663db4745966 /mnt/drive3 ext4 defaults 0 1
```

Reload the system to apply the changes:

```bash
sudo mount -a
```

## Final `/etc/fstab` Configuration:
```bash
# Western Digital 4TB #1
/dev/disk/by-uuid/5feead0e-89c5-4339-a777-fcbfa9ace876 /mnt/drive1 ext4 defaults 0 1

# Western Digital 4TB #2
/dev/disk/by-uuid/9b73c31c-e610-4f56-8e3f-7362f61904fa /mnt/drive2 ext4 defaults 0 1

# Seagate External 14TB
/dev/disk/by-uuid/b40810fe-764a-428a-8f0c-663db4745966 /mnt/drive3 ext4 defaults 0 1
```

## Installing Samba

To install Samba on the system, run the following command:

```bash
sudo apt install samba
```

Once installed, start and enable the Samba service:

```bash
sudo systemctl start smbd
sudo systemctl enable smbd
```

Verify that the Samba service is running:

```bash
sudo systemctl status smbd
```

## Samba Configuration

To configure the `Public` share, update your `/etc/samba/smb.conf` file with the following:

```ini
[Public]
   path = /mnt/drive3
   browseable = yes
   read only = yes
   guest ok = yes
   write list = kyle, liz
```

Restart the Samba service to apply the changes:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart smbd
```

## Adding the `liz` User to the System

To add the `liz` user to the system, use the following command:

```bash
sudo adduser liz
```

Follow the prompts to create the user and set a password.

## Adding Users to Samba

To add the `kyle` and `liz` users to Samba, use the following commands:

```bash
sudo smbpasswd -a kyle
sudo smbpasswd -a liz
```

This will prompt you to set Samba-specific passwords for both users.

## Testing the Samba Configuration with `smbclient`

To test the Samba configuration from a client machine, use the `smbclient` tool to connect to the share. For example, to test the `Public` share:

For the `kyle` user:

```bash
smbclient //nas.lan/Public -U kyle
```

For the `liz` user:

```bash
smbclient //nas.lan/Public -U liz
```

For guest access (if allowed):

```bash
smbclient //nas.lan/Public -N
```

Use the `ls` command within `smbclient` to list the contents of the share:

```bash
ls
```

## Unmount the Drives
Ensure the drives are unmounted before proceeding.

```
sudo umount /mnt/drive1
sudo umount /mnt/drive2
```

## Scan for Bad Sectors Using `badblocks`
Use `badblocks` to scan for bad sectors on each drive. This will perform a non-destructive read-only test.

```
sudo badblocks -sv /dev/sdb
sudo badblocks -sv /dev/sdc
```

If you'd like a more thorough test (which will take longer), you can use the following command, which writes test patterns to the disk and reads them back:

```
sudo badblocks -wsv /dev/sdb
sudo badblocks -wsv /dev/sdc
```

**Warning**: Using the `-w` option will destroy all data on the drives.

## Install ZFS on Ubuntu Server 24.04
Install the ZFS utilities if they are not already installed:

```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install zfsutils-linux
```

## Destroy the Current ext4 Filesystem (if necessary)
After scanning for bad sectors, if you are certain you want to proceed, youâ€™ll need to wipe the existing ext4 partitions on both drives:

```
sudo wipefs -a /dev/sdb
sudo wipefs -a /dev/sdc
```

## Create a New ZFS Pool
Once the partitions are wiped, create a ZFS pool. Replace `media` with your desired pool name.

- For a mirrored setup (provides redundancy):

```
sudo zpool create media mirror /dev/sdb /dev/sdc
```

- For a striped setup (combines space without redundancy):

```
sudo zpool create media /dev/sdb /dev/sdc
```

## Check the Status of the ZFS Pool
Verify the status of the new ZFS pool:

```
sudo zpool status
```

## Set Auto-Mount at Boot (Optional)
Ensure the ZFS pool mounts automatically at boot:

```
sudo zpool set autoexpand=on media
```

## Plex

Install Plex on the server by [downloading the deb](https://www.plex.tv/media-server-downloads/?cat=computer&plat=linux) or by running:

```shell
curl -L https://downloads.plex.tv/plex-media-server-new/1.40.5.8921-836b34c27/debian/plexmediaserver_1.40.5.8921-836b34c27_amd64.deb | sudo dpkg -i -
```

Visit https://www.plex.tv/claim/, log in, and then copy the claim code.

Claim your Plex instance using the claim code you generated earlier by running the following command on the server:

```shell
curl -X POST 'http://127.0.0.1:32400/myplex/claim?token=CLAIM_CODE' 
```

This request may take a while to complete.

### WTF

On the server, stop Plex:

```shell
sudo systemctl stop plexmediaserver
```

Edit the Plex configuration file:

```shell
sudo nano /var/lib/plexmediaserver/Library/Application\ Support/Plex\ Media\ Server/Preferences.xml
```

And remove the values from the following attributes, if they exist:

* `PlexOnlineName`
* `PlexOnlineToken`
* `PlexOnlineEmail`
* `PlexOnlineHome` (if it exists)

Start Plex:

```shell
sudo systemctl start plexmediaserver
```

Try again.
