# Gingerbread Cookies

## Ingredients

* 440 grams (3 1/2 cups) all-purpose flour
* 1 teaspoon baking soda
* 1/2 teaspoon salt
* 1 tablespoon ground ginger
* 1 tablespoon ground cinnamon
* 1/2 teaspoon ground allspice
* 1/2 teaspoon ground cloves
* 145 grams (10 tablespoons, 2/3 cup) unsalted butter, softened
* 150 grams (3/4 cup) packed brown sugar
* 200 grams (2/3 cup) unsulphured molasses (not blackstrap)
* 1 large egg, at room temperature
* 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
* Cookie icing or royal icing (optional)

## Instructions

1. In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, salt, ginger, cinnamon, allspice, and cloves.
2. In a separate large bowl, beat the butter with an electric mixer on medium speed until smooth and creamy, about 1 minute. Add brown sugar and molasses, beating on medium-high speed until well combined and creamy, scraping bowl as needed.
3. Beat in egg and vanilla on high speed for 2 minutes, scraping bowl as needed. Don't worry if the mixture looks slightly separated.
4. Add the flour mixture to the wet ingredients and beat on low speed until combined. Dough will be thick and slightly sticky.
5. Divide dough in half. Shape each half into a disc and wrap tightly in plastic wrap. Refrigerate for at least 3 hours or up to 3 days.
6. Preheat oven to 350Â°F. Line baking sheets with parchment paper.
7. Working with one disc at a time, roll dough on a generously floured surface to 1/4-inch thickness. If dough cracks, let it warm slightly and use fingers to press cracks together. Cut into desired shapes and place 1 inch apart on prepared sheets.
8. Bake for 9-10 minutes for 4-inch cookies, 8 minutes for smaller cookies, or 11 minutes for larger cookies. Rotate pans halfway through baking.
9. Let cool on sheets for 5 minutes, then transfer to wire rack to cool completely.
10. Decorate cooled cookies with icing if desired.

## Notes

Makes about 24 4-inch cookies. Store covered at room temperature for up to 1 week. For softer cookies, use the shorter baking times. Dough must be chilled before rolling. Re-rolled scraps may be slightly easier to work with than the first roll.
