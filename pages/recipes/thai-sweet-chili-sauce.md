# Thai Sweet Chili Sauce

## Ingredients

* 4 2/3 cups water, divided
* 2 cups rice vinegar
* 2 cups cider vinegar
* 4 cups granulated sugar
* 6 teaspoons salt
* 1 cup chopped red Fresno or red jalape√±o chilies (about 14 chilies, 70 grams)
* 2 cups chopped red bell peppers (about 2 peppers, 300 grams)
* 1/2 cup finely shredded carrot
* 12 garlic cloves, minced
* 2/3 cup plus 3 tablespoons Clear Jel or similar modified cornstarch

## Instructions

1. Seed and roughly chop chilies and bell peppers. Shred carrot using the second-finest holes of a box grater. Mince garlic.
2. In a medium saucepan over medium-high heat, combine 4 cups water with the vinegars, sugar, and salt. Stir until sugar and salt dissolve completely.
3. Add the prepared chilies, bell peppers, carrot, and garlic. Bring mixture to a boil and cook for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.
4. In a separate bowl, whisk the Clear Jel with remaining 2/3 cup water until smooth. While stirring the sauce vigorously, pour this slurry into the boiling mixture in a steady stream.
5. Continue stirring constantly and return mixture to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer for 1 minute, or until thickened.
6. Ladle hot sauce into clean, hot half-pint jars, leaving 1/4-inch headspace. Remove air bubbles using a chopstick or bubble tool. Adjust headspace with additional hot sauce if needed.
7. Wipe jar rims clean with a paper towel dipped in vinegar. Center lids on jars and apply rings until fingertip-tight.
8. Process in a boiling water bath, ensuring jars are covered by 2 inches of water. Process for 10 minutes with lid on.
9. Remove jars and let cool undisturbed for 12-24 hours.

## Notes

Makes approximately 14 half-pint jars. Store sealed jars in a cool, dark place for up to 1 year. Refrigerate after opening and use within 3 weeks.
