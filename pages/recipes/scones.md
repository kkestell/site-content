# Scones

## Ingredients

* 240 grams (2 cups) all-purpose flour
* 100 grams (1/2 cup) granulated sugar
* 1/2 teaspoon salt
* 1 tablespoon baking powder
* 115 grams (1/2 cup, 1 stick) unsalted butter, frozen
* 120 milliliters (1/2 cup) heavy cream or buttermilk
* 1 large egg
* 1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract
* 1-1 1/2 cups add-ins such as chocolate chips, berries, nuts, fruit, etc.
* coarse sugar for topping (optional)

## Instructions

1. In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, salt, and baking powder. Grate the frozen butter into the dry ingredients, then cut it in with a pastry cutter until the mixture is crumbly. Gently stir in your chosen add-ins. Place the bowl in the refrigerator to chill.
2. In a separate bowl, whisk together the cream, egg, and vanilla extract until well combined. Place in the refrigerator.
3. Line a sheet pan with parchment paper.
4. After chilling for 15 minutes, remove both bowls from the refrigerator. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and mix just until no dry flour remains. Do not overmix.
5. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface. Working quickly, gather the dough together and press into a cohesive mass.
6. Pat or roll the dough into a 2-inch x 10-inch rectangle.
7. Using a sharp knife, cut the rectangle into 5 equal squares, then cut each square diagonally to create 10 triangles.
8. Place the triangles on a plate or baking sheet, then refrigerate for 15-30 minutes.
9. Meanwhile, preheat oven to 400Â°F and position rack in middle-low position. Line a sheet pan with parchment paper.
10. When ready to bake, transfer the chilled scones to the prepared pan, spacing them 2-3 inches apart.
11. Brush the tops with additional cream and sprinkle generously with coarse sugar, if using.
12. Bake for 18-26 minutes, or until edges are golden and top is light brown.
13. Let cool on pan for 5 minutes, then transfer to wire rack to cool completely.
