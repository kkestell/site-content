# Drunken Noodles

## Ingredients

### For the Sauce

* 1/4 cup oyster sauce
* 1/4 cup soy sauce
* 1 teaspoon dark soy sauce (optional)
* 1 tablespoon fish sauce
* 2 tablespoons palm sugar (or brown sugar)
* 2 tablespoons cold water

### For the Drunken Noodles

* 8 ounces dried wide rice noodles
* 2 tablespoons vegetable oil
* 1 teaspoon sesame oil
* 1 cup shallots, thinly sliced
* 6 teaspoons thai chili, thinly sliced
* 4 cloves garlic, minced
* 2 1/2 pounds chicken or pork, thinly sliced
* 1 pound Chinese broccoli, thinly sliced (optional)
* 4 scallions, thinly sliced
* 1 cup fresh Thai basil leaves

## Instructions

1. Soak rice noodles in hot water until flexible, 10 to 15 minutes. Occasionally move the noodles around to separate them. Drain the water and cover with a wet paper towel until ready to use.
2. While the noodles are soaking, prepare the sauce by combining oyster sauce, soy sauce, dark soy sauce, fish sauce, sugar, and water in a small bowl.
3. Heat vegetable oil and sesame oil in a wok or large frying pan over medium-high heat. Stir-fry shallots, chili, and garlic until shallots are soft, about 2 minutes. Move the mixture around the outside of the pan to create a space and add your protein. Sear for 1 minute, then combine with shallot mixture.
4. Add Chinese broccoli stems and stir-fry until tender, about 2 minutes.
5. Add Chinese broccoli leaves and stir-fry until wilted.
6. Add drunken noodle sauce and mix. Cook until sauce begins to simmer.
7. Add soaked rice noodles and toss to coat until noodles have absorbed the sauce and are cooked through, about 2 minutes. Remove from heat.
8. Stir in Thai basil and scallion.
