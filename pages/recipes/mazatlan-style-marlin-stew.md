# Mazatlan Style Marlin Stew

NOTE: Marlin can be challenging to find outside of regions where it is commonly fished, such as the Pacific coast of Mexico. If marlin is not available, you can substitute another firm, meaty fish like mahi-mahi, which is what we use. Swordfish or tuna would also work well.

## Ingredients

* 1 1/2 cups smoked marlin
* 1 cup chopped carrot
* 1 cup chopped celery
* 1 cup chopped green beans
* 2 cups tomato purée
* 1 1/2-2 quarts chicken stock
* 1/4 cup canned sliced jalapeño chiles
* 1/4 cup vinegar from the can of jalapeños
* 1/4 cup green olives, chopped (optional)
* 2-3 bay leaves
* 2 teaspoons oregano
* 3 tablespoons olive oil
* 1/4-1/2 white onion, minced
* 2-3 cloves garlic, finely minced
* Fresh lime, minced cilantro, minced onion for garnish

## Instructions

1. Chop marlin into bite-sized pieces. Set aside.
2. Chop the carrot, celery, and green beans into uniform pieces for even cooking. Mince the onion and garlic finely.
3. In a large pot, heat the olive oil over medium heat.
4. Add the minced white onion and garlic to the pot. Sauté until the onion becomes translucent and the garlic is fragrant, about 3-4 minutes.
5. Add the chopped carrot, celery, and green beans to the pot. Stir well to combine with the onion and garlic. Cook for about 5-7 minutes until the vegetables begin to soften.
6. Pour in the tomato purée, stirring to combine it with the sautéed vegetables.
7. Add 1 1/2 to 2 quarts of stock, depending on the desired consistency of the soup. Stir well.
8. Add the bay leaves and oregano. Stir to incorporate the seasonings.
9. Bring the mixture to a gentle boil. Reduce the heat to low and let it simmer for about 20-25 minutes, or until the vegetables are tender.
10. Add the chopped smoked fish to the pot. Stir to combine.
11. Add the canned sliced jalapeño peppers and the vinegar from the can. Stir well.
12. If using, add the chopped green olives. Stir to incorporate all ingredients.
13. Before serving, remove the bay leaves from the soup.
14. Serve the soup hot, garnished with fresh lime wedges, minced cilantro, and minced onion.
