# Chocolate Chip Cookies

## Ingredients

* 1/2 cup (1 stick) butter, softened
* 100 grams (1/2 cup) white sugar
* 100 grams (1/2 cup) packed brown sugar
* 1 large egg
* 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
* 1/2 teaspoon baking soda
* 1 teaspoon hot water
* 1/4 teaspoon salt
* 180 grams (1 1/2 cups) all-purpose flour
* 1 cup semisweet chocolate chips
* 1/2 cup chopped walnuts

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 350Â°F. Line baking sheets with parchment paper.
2. In a large bowl, beat the softened butter until smooth. Add both white and brown sugars gradually, beating until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes.
3. Beat in the egg until fully incorporated, then stir in the vanilla extract until combined.
4. In a small bowl, dissolve the baking soda in hot water. Add to the butter mixture along with the salt, stirring until well combined.
5. Gradually stir in the flour until just combined. Fold in the chocolate chips and walnuts until evenly distributed.
6. Drop rounded tablespoons of dough onto the prepared baking sheets, spacing them 2 inches apart.
7. Bake for 10 minutes, or until edges are golden brown and centers are set but still soft.
8. Let cool on sheets for 5 minutes, then transfer to wire rack to cool completely.
