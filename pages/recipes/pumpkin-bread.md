# Pumpkin Bread

## Ingredients

* 220 grams (1 3/4 cups) all-purpose flour
* 1 teaspoon baking soda
* 1 1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
* 1 1/2 teaspoons pumpkin pie spice
* 1/4 teaspoon ground ginger
* 1/2 teaspoon salt
* 120 milliliters (1/2 cup) vegetable oil
* 100 grams (1/2 cup) granulated sugar
* 50 grams (1/4 cup) packed brown sugar
* 60 milliliters (1/4 cup) molasses
* 340 grams (1 1/2 cups) canned pumpkin puree
* 2 large eggs
* 45 milliliters (3 tablespoons) milk

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 375Â°F. Grease a 9x5" loaf pan and line with parchment paper, leaving overhang on the long sides.
2. In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, cinnamon, pumpkin pie spice, ginger, and salt until well combined.
3. In a medium bowl, whisk together the oil, granulated sugar, brown sugar, and molasses until combined. Add pumpkin puree, eggs, and milk, whisking until smooth.
4. Make a well in the center of the dry ingredients. Pour in the wet ingredients and fold together gently with a rubber spatula just until no dry flour remains. Do not overmix.
5. Pour batter into the prepared loaf pan and smooth the top.
6. Bake for 50-55 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into center comes out clean. Tent with foil after 30-35 minutes.
7. Let cool in pan for 10 minutes, then use parchment overhang to lift bread out of pan. Transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.
