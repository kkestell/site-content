# Grilled Flank Steak with Rosemary

From Aunt Ver.

## Ingredients

* 1/2 cup soy sauce
* 1/2 cup olive oil
* 4 1/2 tablespoons honey
* 6 large garlic cloves, minced
* 3 tablespoons chopped fresh rosemary
* 1 1/2 tablespoons coarsely ground black pepper
* 1 flank steak (1 to 2 1/4 pounds)

## Instructions

1. In a 13 x 9 x 2-inch glass baking dish, mix the soy sauce, olive oil, honey, garlic, rosemary, and black pepper.
2. Add the flank steak to the dish and turn to coat it evenly with the marinade.
3. Cover the dish and refrigerate for 2 hours, turning the steak occasionally.
4. Prepare a grill (medium-high heat) or preheat the broiler.
5. Remove the steak from the marinade and discard the marinade.
6. Grill the steak to the desired doneness, about 4 minutes per side for medium-rare.
7. Transfer the steak to a work surface and let it stand for 5 minutes.
8. Cut the steak across the grain into thin strips (cutting against the grain ensures tenderness).
9. Arrange the strips on a platter and serve immediately.
