# Red Lentil Soup

## Ingredients

* 3 tablespoons olive oil, plus more for serving
* 1 large onion, finely chopped
* 2 garlic cloves, minced
* 1 tablespoon tomato paste
* 1 teaspoon ground cumin
* 1/4 teaspoon ground turmeric
* Kosher salt and black pepper, to taste
* 1 pinch Aleppo chili, plus more for serving
* 4 cups chicken broth
* 2 cups water
* 1 cup red lentils
* 1 large carrot, peeled and diced
* Juice of 1/2 lemon
* 3 tablespoons fresh cilantro, chopped

## Instructions

1. Heat olive oil in a large pot over medium-low heat. Add onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until deeply caramelized, about 20 minutes.
2. Add garlic and cook until fragrant, about 3 minutes.
3. Increase heat to medium. Add tomato paste and cook until darkened, about 1 minute. Add cumin, turmeric, a generous pinch of salt, black pepper, and Aleppo chili. Cook until spices are fragrant, about 2 minutes.
4. Add broth, water, lentils, and carrot. Bring to a simmer, then lower heat and partially cover. Cook until lentils are tender and beginning to break down, about 20 minutes. Taste and adjust seasoning with salt.
5. Using an immersion blender, partially blend about half the soup while leaving some texture.
6. Return to heat if needed to warm through. Stir in lemon juice and cilantro.
7. Serve hot, drizzled with olive oil and topped with an additional sprinkle of Aleppo chili.
