# Chicken and Apricot Tagine

## Ingredients

* 2 tablespoons olive oil
* 3-4 chicken thighs, bone-in, skin-on
* 1 medium yellow onion, halved, then sliced 1/4-inch thick
* 4 garlic cloves, finely chopped
* 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
* 1 teaspoon ground ginger
* 1/2 teaspoon turmeric
* 1/2 teaspoon black pepper
* 1 teaspoon kosher salt
* 5 sprigs fresh cilantro
* 5 sprigs fresh flat-leaf parsley
* 1/2 cup chicken stock
* 1 cup water
* 2 tablespoons mild honey
* 1 (3-inch) cinnamon stick
* 1/2 cup dried apricots, halved
* 1/3 cup sliced almonds

## Instructions

1. Heat olive oil in a heavy skillet over medium heat. Working in batches if needed, sear chicken thighs skin-side down until golden brown, 8-12 minutes per side. Remove to a plate and reserve.
2. In the same skillet, reduce heat to medium-low. Add onion with a pinch of salt and cook, stirring occasionally, until deeply caramelized, 35-45 minutes.
3. Add garlic and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Stir in ground cinnamon, ginger, turmeric, pepper, and salt until spices are toasted and aromatic.
4. Return chicken and any accumulated juices to the skillet. Tie cilantro and parsley into a bundle with kitchen twine and add to pan along with stock. Cover and simmer over low heat for 30 minutes.
5. Meanwhile, combine apricots, water, honey, and cinnamon stick in a small saucepan. Bring to simmer and cook until apricots are tender and liquid has reduced to a glaze, 10-15 minutes.
6. While chicken and apricots cook, toast almonds in a 350Â°F oven until golden brown and fragrant, about 5 minutes. Set aside.
7. Add glazed apricot mixture to chicken during the final 10 minutes of cooking.
8. Remove herb bundle and cinnamon stick. Serve hot over couscous, topped with toasted almonds.
