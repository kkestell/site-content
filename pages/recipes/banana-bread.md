# Banana Bread

## Ingredients

* 1/2 cup (1 stick) butter, softened
* 1 cup granulated sugar
* 2 large eggs
* 2 bananas, previously frozen, thawed, and mashed
* 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
* 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
* 1/4 teaspoon salt
* 1 teaspoon baking soda
* 1/2 teaspoon baking powder
* 1/2 cup chopped walnuts (optional)

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 350°F. Grease an 8x4-inch loaf pan.
2. In a large bowl, beat the softened butter until smooth. Add the granulated sugar gradually, beating until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes.
3. Beat in the eggs one at a time, ensuring each is fully incorporated before adding the next.
4. Stir in the mashed bananas and vanilla extract until well combined.
5. In a separate bowl, sift together the flour, salt, baking soda, and baking powder. Add to the wet ingredients in three additions, mixing until almost combined after each addition.
6. Gently fold in the chopped walnuts until just distributed.
7. Transfer batter to the prepared pan and smooth the top with a spatula.
8. Bake for 50-55 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into center comes out clean.
9. Let cool in pan for 10 minutes, then remove from pan and cool completely on wire rack.

## Notes

For muffins, spoon into 10 prepared muffin cups and bake at 350°F for 20 minutes.
