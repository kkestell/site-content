# No-Soak Instant Pot Beans

## Ingredients

* 2 cups dried beans
* 6 cups water
* 1 teaspoon salt
* smoked ham hock or ham bone (optional)

## Instructions

1. Rinse the beans under cold water and pick out any stones or debris.
2. Add the beans, water, salt, and ham hock or bone to the Instant Pot.
3. Seal the lid and set the Instant Pot to cook on high pressure for 30 minutes.
4. Allow the pressure to release naturally for 20 minutes, then manually release any remaining pressure.
5. Remove the ham hock or bone and discard.
6. Drain the beans and use as desired, for example in red beans and rice.

## Notes

Cook kidney beans for 40 minutes, pinto beans for 30 minutes, small red beans for 30 minutes, black beans for 25 minutes, navy beans for 25 minutes, and chickpeas for 45 minutes. Undercooked kidney beans contain phytohaemagglutinin, which can cause food poisoning.
