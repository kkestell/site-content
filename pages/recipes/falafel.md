## Ingredients

* 2 cups dried chickpeas
* 1/2 teaspoon baking soda
* 1 cup fresh parsley leaves
* 3/4 cup fresh cilantro leaves
* 1/2 cup fresh dill
* 1 small onion, quartered
* 7-8 garlic cloves, peeled

* 1 tablespoon ground coriander
* 1 teaspoon cayenne pepper
* 1 teaspoon baking powder
* 2 tablespoons toasted sesame seeds

## Instructions

1. Place dried chickpeas and baking soda in a large bowl. Cover with cold water by at least 2 inches and soak overnight (12-24 hours). Drain well and pat dry with paper towels before using.

3. Transfer mixture to a container, cover tightly, and refrigerate for at least 1 hour or up to overnight to allow flavors to meld.
4. Just before frying, stir in baking powder and sesame seeds. Season generously with salt to taste.
