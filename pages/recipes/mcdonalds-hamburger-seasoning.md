# McDonald’s Hamburger Seasoning

## Ingredients

* 4 tablespoons fine salt
* 2 tablespoons MSG
* 1 teaspoon finely ground black pepper
* 1/4 teaspoon onion powder

## Instructions

1. Combine all ingredients in a small bowl. Mix well.
2. Store in an airtight container.
3. Use as desired to season hamburgers.

## Notes

McDonald's uses "Q-ing ovens" to keep their burgers warm and juicy after they're grilled. At home, you can get a similar result by assembling the burgers as soon as they come off the grill and then wrapping them in wax paper. This helps keep them warm and moist until you're ready to serve.
