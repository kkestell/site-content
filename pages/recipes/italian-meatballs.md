# Italian Meatballs

## Ingredients

* 2 large eggs
* 1 cup milk
* 1 cup plain bread crumbs
* 1/4 cup grated Pecorino Romano cheese
* 1 teaspoon salt
* 1 teaspoon Italian seasoning
* 1 pound bulk sweet Italian pork sausage
* 1-1 1/2 pounds ground beef

## Instructions

1. In a large bowl, whisk together eggs and milk. Add bread crumbs and let mixture soak for 10 minutes to form a panade.
2. Add Pecorino Romano, salt, and Italian seasoning to the panade, stirring to combine.
3. Add sausage and ground beef to the bowl. Mix gently with your hands just until ingredients are evenly combined. Do not overmix.
4. Preheat oven to 375Â°F. Set a wire rack inside a rimmed baking sheet.
5. Form mixture into meatballs of desired size (about 2 tablespoons each), being careful not to pack too tightly.
6. Arrange meatballs on the prepared rack, leaving space between each.
7. Bake for 30-35 minutes, or until meatballs are golden brown and cooked through.

## Notes

Makes approximately 24 two-inch meatballs. The panade (bread and milk mixture) helps keep the meatballs tender. For best results, avoid overmixing the meat and don't compress the meatballs too firmly when shaping.
