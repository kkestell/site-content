# Pumpkin Muffins

## Ingredients

* 220 grams (1 3/4 cups) all-purpose flour
* 1 teaspoon baking soda
* 1 1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
* 1 1/2 teaspoons pumpkin pie spice
* 1/4 teaspoon ground ginger
* 1/2 teaspoon salt
* 120 milliliters (1/2 cup) vegetable oil
* 100 grams (1/2 cup) granulated sugar
* 100 grams (1/2 cup) packed brown sugar
* 340 grams (1 1/2 cups) canned pumpkin puree
* 2 large eggs
* 60 milliliters (1/4 cup) milk

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 425°F. Line a standard 12-cup muffin tin with paper liners.
2. In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, cinnamon, pumpkin pie spice, ginger, and salt until well combined.
3. In a medium bowl, whisk together the oil, granulated sugar, and brown sugar until combined. Add pumpkin puree, eggs, and milk, whisking until smooth.
4. Make a well in the center of the dry ingredients. Pour in the wet ingredients and fold together gently with a rubber spatula just until no dry flour remains. Do not overmix.
5. Divide batter among the prepared muffin cups, filling each to the top.
6. Bake at 425°F for 5 minutes, then, without opening the oven door, reduce temperature to 350°F. Continue baking for 16-17 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into center comes out clean.
7. Let cool in pan for 5 minutes, then transfer to wire rack to cool completely.

## Notes

Total baking time is 21-22 minutes. The initial high-temperature bake helps create tall, domed muffin tops.
