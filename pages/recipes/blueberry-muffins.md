# Blueberry Muffins

## Ingredients

### For the Streusel

* 50 grams (1/4 cup) granulated sugar
* 25 grams (2 tablespoons) all-purpose flour
* 2 tablespoons butter, cubed and chilled
* 2 tablespoons sliced almonds (optional)
* 1/4 teaspoon salt

### For the Muffins

* 180 grams (1 1/2 cups) all-purpose flour, plus 1 tablespoon for dusting blueberries
* 150 grams (3/4 cup) granulated sugar
* 2 teaspoons baking powder
* 1/2 teaspoon salt
* 1/3 cup vegetable oil
* 1 large egg
* 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
* 1/3 cup whole milk, or more as needed
* 1 cup fresh blueberries

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 400Â°F. Line a standard muffin tin with 9 paper liners.
2. To make the streusel, combine the sugar, flour, and salt in a medium bowl. Add the cold, cubed butter and work it into the dry ingredients with your fingertips until the mixture forms coarse crumbs. Stir in the almonds if using. Refrigerate until needed.
3. In a small bowl, toss the blueberries with 1 tablespoon flour until lightly coated. This will help prevent them from sinking during baking.
4. In a large bowl, sift together the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt.
5. Using a 2-cup measuring cup, combine the oil, egg, and vanilla extract. Whisk until thoroughly blended, then add enough milk to bring the total liquid volume to the 1-cup mark. Whisk again until well combined.
6. Make a well in the center of the dry ingredients. Pour in the wet ingredients and stir with a rubber spatula just until no dry flour remains. The batter will be very thick; do not overmix.
7. Gently fold in the floured blueberries until evenly distributed.
8. Divide the batter among the prepared muffin cups, filling each to the top. The cups will be very full.
9. Remove streusel from refrigerator and sprinkle about 1 tablespoon over each muffin.
10. Bake for 20 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into center comes out clean and tops are golden brown.
11. Let cool in pan for 5 minutes, then transfer to wire rack to cool completely.

## Notes

Replacing the milk with sour cream works well. So does blueberry yogurt.
